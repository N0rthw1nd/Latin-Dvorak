# Latin-Dvorak
Variant of the [![Programmer Dvorak](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak)](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak) keyboard layout with addictional accents and letters for Italian, French and Spanish. Greek letters for computer science are included, too.

NOTE:
This layout works better for Italian and English writing (cause I made it for my personal use), but it could also be used for French and Spanish writing.
All the additional Characters for non-English languages can be accessed using the "Compose Keys" for level 3 and level 4, in my case they are <AltGr> and <AltGr+Shift> but they can differ basing on your OS configuration.

# Main Features

- Numbers are placed in Shift position in their standard order: 1..0 
- The accents are placed on the homerow where the vowels lay: grave accents are on level 3 and acute accents are on level 4.
- Character 'È' has been placed on level 3 in the 'è' position for an Italian Keyboard.
- Greek letters are placed on the lower row except of Δ in the 'd' position on level 3 for a standar dvorak 
- The characters for computational complexity have been placed under the left homerow, on level 3 the uppercase and on level 4 the lowercase (that's beauce the first ones are more used)
